# Precision Farming Agent 🌾

## Project Overview
This project is an **Autonomous Agronomy Assistant** designed to help farmers and gardeners plan their crop cycles. Unlike standard chatbots, this agent:
1.  **Autonomous Research**: actively searches the web for verified data if it doesn't know a crop (e.g., "Ghost Peppers").
2.  **Strict Security**: Enforces a strict whitelist, only learning from trusted gov/edu sites (FAO, USDA, Cornell).
3.  **Structured Planning**: Generates a strictly formatted **JSON Timetable** linking input names (Ingredients) to specific dates (Timetable).
4.  **Local Privacy**: Runs 100% locally using `Mistral-7B` via `llama.cpp`.

## Results Showcase: "Ghost Pepper Timetable"
Here is the actual output generated by the agent for a new crop it requested from the web:

### 1. Web Search
The agent autonomously performed this strict query:
> `Timetable for growing Ghost Peppers (site:fao.org OR site:usda.gov OR site:cals.cornell.edu)`

### 2. Generated Schedule
The agent synthesized this chronological plan:

| Stage | Timing | Action | Input Needed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Planting** | Late Spring | Plant seeds in well-prepared soil (Temp 70-95°F) | Seeds |
| **Seedling** | Weeks 1-2 | Monitor for emergence, keep moist | Water |
| **Vegetative** | Weeks 4-6 | Apply Nitrogen side-dressing | Nitrogen (40lbs/acre) |
| **Fruiting** | Weeks 8-12 | Apply Potassium for fruit set | Potassium |
| **Harvest** | Month 4 | Pick when red and soft | - |

## UI Visualization
The project features a **Streamlit Web Interface**.
*   **See it in action**: Open `frontend_snapshot.html` in your browser to see a captured state of the interface.
*   **Clean Design**: Features a chat interface where complex JSON is rendered into readable tables.

## System Capabilities
*   **Autonomous Data Collection**: `duckduckgo-search` + `ScraperTool`.
*   **Intelligent Synthesis**: `Mistral-7B` (Local) with Schema Fallback.
*   **Robustness**: Error handling for JSON validation failures ensures data delivery.

## Limitations & Improvements
*   **Inference Speed**: Local CPU inference takes ~30-60s.
*   **Future**: Plan to upgrade to `Mixtral-8x7B` and add PDF export functionality.
